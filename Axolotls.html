    <h1>Axolotls</h1>
    <p>The axolotl is a paedomorphic salamander. Axolotls are unusual
    compared to other amphibians in that when they reach adulthood axolotls do not metamorphisis and take to the land.
    Instead, adults remain aquatic and gilled. 
    The species was originally found in several lakes underlying what is now Mexico City, such as Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco.
    These lakes were drained by Spanish settlers after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, leading to the destruction of much of the axolotlâ€™s natural habitat.</p>
    <p>The axolotl is nearly extinct due to water pollution and the destruction of their original habitat. We must be protected !</p>
    <p>They have been listed as critically endangered in the wild ranging from 50 to 1000 only</p>
    <p>Not only have they been extensively used in medical research to save lives they are also incredibely cute we must save them</p>
